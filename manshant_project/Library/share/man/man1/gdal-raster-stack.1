.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This program combine together input bands from GDAL datasets into a dataset, that can be
either a virtual stack in the \fI\%VRT (Virtual Dataset)\fP format,
or in a more conventional raster format such as GeoTIFF.
.sp
All bands of each input file are added as separate
output bands, unless \fI\%\-b\fP is specified to select a subset of them.
.sp
The list of input GDAL datasets can be specified at the end
of the command line or put in a text file (one filename per line) for very long lists.
Wildcards \(aq*\(aq, \(aq?\(aq or \(aq[\(aq] of \fI\%VSIGlob()\fP can be used, even on files located
on network file systems such as /vsis3/, /vsigs/, /vsiaz/, etc.
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-of, \-\-format, \-\-output\-format <OUTPUT\-FORMAT>
Which output raster format to use. Allowed values may be given by
\fBgdal \-\-formats | grep raster | grep rw | sort\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-co <NAME>=<VALUE>
Many formats have one or more optional creation options that can be
used to control particulars about the file created. For instance,
the GeoTIFF driver supports creation options to control compression,
and whether the file should be tiled.
.sp
May be repeated.
.sp
The creation options available vary by format driver, and some
simple formats have no creation options at all. A list of options
supported for a format can be listed with the
\fI\%\-\-formats\fP
command line option but the documentation for the format is the
definitive source of information on driver creation options.
See \fI\%Raster drivers\fP format
specific documentation for legal creation options for each format.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-overwrite
Allow program to overwrite existing target file or dataset.
Otherwise, by default, \fBgdal\fP errors out if the target file or
dataset already exists.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b <band>
Select an input <band> to be processed. Bands are numbered from 1.
If input bands not set all bands will be added to the output.
Multiple \fI\%\-b\fP switches may be used to select a set of input bands.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-resolution {<xres,yres>|same|highest|lowest|average}
In case the resolution of all input files is not the same, the \fI\%\-\-resolution\fP flag
enables the user to control the way the output resolution is computed.
.sp
\fIsame\fP, the default, checks that all source rasters have the same resolution and errors out when this is not the case.
.sp
\fIhighest\fP will pick the smallest values of pixel dimensions within the set of source rasters.
.sp
\fIlowest\fP will pick the largest values of pixel dimensions within the set of source rasters.
.sp
\fIaverage\fP will compute an average of pixel dimensions within the set of source rasters.
.sp
\fIcommon\fP determines the greatest common divisor of the source pixel dimensions, e.g. 0.2 for source pixel dimensions of 0.4 and 0.6.
.sp
<xres>,<yres>. The values must be expressed in georeferenced units.
Both must be positive values.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-bbox <xmin>,<ymin>,<xmax>,<ymax>
Set georeferenced extents of output file. The values must be expressed in georeferenced units.
If not specified, the extent of the output is the minimum bounding box of the set of source rasters.
Pixels within the extent of the output but not covered by a source raster will be read as valid
pixels with a value of zero unless a NODATA value is specified using \fI\%\-\-dst\-nodata\fP
or an alpha mask band is added with \fI\%\-\-add\-alpha\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-target\-aligned\-pixels
(target aligned pixels) align
the coordinates of the extent of the output file to the values of the \fI\%\-\-resolution\fP,
such that the aligned extent includes the minimum extent.
Alignment means that xmin / resx, ymin / resy, xmax / resx and ymax / resy are integer values.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-src\-nodata <value>[,<value>]...
Set nodata values for input bands (different values can be supplied for each band).
If the option is not specified, the intrinsic nodata settings on the source datasets
will be used (if they exist). The value set by this option is written in the NODATA element
of each \fBComplexSource\fP element.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-dst\-nodata <value>[,<value>]...
Set nodata values at the output band level (different values can be supplied for each band).  If more
than one value is supplied, all values should be quoted to keep them together
as a single operating system argument. If the option is not specified,
intrinsic nodata settings on the first dataset will be used (if they exist). The value set by this option
is written in the \fBNoDataValue\fP element of each \fBVRTRasterBand element\fP\&. Use a value of
\fINone\fP to ignore intrinsic nodata settings on the source datasets.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-hide\-nodata
Even if any band contains nodata value, giving this option makes the output band
not report the NoData. Useful when you want to control the background color of
the dataset. By using along with the \fI\%\-\-add\-alpha\fP option, you can prepare a
dataset which doesn\(aqt report nodata value but is transparent in areas with no
data.
.UNINDENT
.SH GDALG OUTPUT (ON-THE-FLY / STREAMED DATASET)
.sp
This program supports serializing the command line as a JSON file using the \fBGDALG\fP output format.
The resulting file can then be opened as a raster dataset using the
\fI\%GDALG: GDAL Streamed Algorithm\fP driver, and apply the specified pipeline in a on\-the\-fly /
streamed way.
