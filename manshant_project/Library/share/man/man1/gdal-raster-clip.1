.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBgdal raster clip\fP can be used to clip a raster dataset using
georeferenced coordinates.
.sp
Either \fI\%\-\-bbox\fP or \fI\%\-\-like\fP must be specified.
.sp
The output dataset is in the same SRS as the input one, and the original
resolution is preserved. Bounds are rounded to match whole pixel locations
(i.e. there is no resampling involved)
.sp
\fBclip\fP can also be used as a step of \fI\%gdal raster pipeline\fP\&.
.SS Standard options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-of, \-\-format, \-\-output\-format <OUTPUT\-FORMAT>
Which output raster format to use. Allowed values may be given by
\fBgdal \-\-formats | grep raster | grep rw | sort\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-co <NAME>=<VALUE>
Many formats have one or more optional creation options that can be
used to control particulars about the file created. For instance,
the GeoTIFF driver supports creation options to control compression,
and whether the file should be tiled.
.sp
May be repeated.
.sp
The creation options available vary by format driver, and some
simple formats have no creation options at all. A list of options
supported for a format can be listed with the
\fI\%\-\-formats\fP
command line option but the documentation for the format is the
definitive source of information on driver creation options.
See \fI\%Raster drivers\fP format
specific documentation for legal creation options for each format.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-overwrite
Allow program to overwrite existing target file or dataset.
Otherwise, by default, \fBgdal\fP errors out if the target file or
dataset already exists.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-bbox <xmin>,<ymin>,<xmax>,<ymax>
Bounds to which to clip the dataset. They are assumed to be in the CRS of
the input dataset, unless \fI\%\-\-bbox\-crs\fP is specified.
The X and Y axis are the \(dqGIS friendly ones\(dq, that is X is longitude or easting,
and Y is latitude or northing.
The bounds are expanded if necessary to match input pixel boundaries.
By default, \fBgdal raster clip\fP will produce an error if the bounds indicated
by \fI\%\-\-bbox\fP are greater than the extents of input dataset. This check can be
bypassed using \fI\%\-\-allow\-bbox\-outside\-source\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-bbox\-crs <CRS>
CRS in which the <xmin>,<ymin>,<xmax>,<ymax> values of \fI\%\-\-bbox\fP
are expressed. If not specified, it is assumed to be the CRS of the input
dataset.
Note that specifying \fI\%\-\-bbox\-crs\fP does not cause the raster to be reprojected.
Instead, the bounds are reprojected from the bbox\-crs to the CRS of the
input dataset.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-geometry <WKT_or_GeoJSON>
Geometry as a WKT or GeoJSON string of a polygon (or multipolygon) to which
to clip the dataset.
Raster areas within the bounding box of the geometry but not inside the
geometry itself will be set to the nodata value of the raster, or 0 if there
is none. All pixels overlapping the geometry will be selected.
If the input geometry is GeoJSON, its CRS is assumed to be WGS84, unless there is
a CRS defined in the GeoJSON geometry or \fI\%\-\-geometry\-crs\fP is specified.
If the input geometry is WKT, its CRS is assumed to be the one of the input dataset,
unless \fI\%\-\-geometry\-crs\fP is specified.
The X and Y axis are the \(dqGIS friendly ones\(dq, that is X is longitude or easting,
and Y is latitude or northing.
Mutually exclusive with \fI\%\-\-bbox\fP and \fI\%\-\-like\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-geometry\-crs <CRS>
CRS in which the coordinates values of \fI\%\-\-geometry\fP
are expressed. If not specified, it is assumed to be the CRS of the input
dataset.
The bounds are reprojected from the geometry\-crs to the CRS of the
input dataset.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-like <DATASET>
Vector or raster dataset to use as a template for bounds.
If the specified dataset is a raster, its rectangular bounds are used as
the clipping geometry.
If the specified dataset is a vector dataset, its polygonal geometries
are unioned together to form the clipping geometry. If several layers are present,
\fI\%\-\-like\-sql\fP or \fI\%\-\-like\-layer\fP must be specified.
Raster areas within the bounding box of the geometry but not inside the
geometry itself will be set to the nodata value of the raster, or 0 if there
is none.
Mutually exclusive with \fI\%\-\-bbox\fP and \fI\%\-\-geometry\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-like\-sql <SELECT\-STATEMENT>
Select desired geometries from the vector clip dataset using an SQL query.
e.g \fBSELECT geom FROM my_layer WHERE country = \(aqFrance\(aq\fP\&.
The SQL dialect used will be the default one of the \fBlike\fP dataset (OGR SQL
for Shapefile, SQLite for GeoPackage, PostgreSQL for PostGIS, etc.).
Mutually exclusive with \fI\%\-\-like\-layer\fP and \fI\%\-\-like\-where\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-like\-layer <LAYER\-NAME>
Select the named layer from the vector clip dataset.
Mutually exclusive with \fI\%\-\-like\-sql\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-like\-where <WHERE\-EXPRESSION>
Restrict desired geometries from vector clip dataset layer based on an attribute query.
e.g \fBcountry = \(aqFrance\(aq\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-only\-bbox
For \fI\%\-\-geometry\fP and \fI\%\-\-like\fP, only consider the bounding box
of the geometry.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-allow\-bbox\-outside\-source
If set, allows the bounds indicated by \fI\%\-\-bbox\fP to cover an extent that is greater
than the input dataset. Output pixels from areas beyond the input extent will be set to
zero or the NoData value of the input dataset.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-addalpha
Adds an alpha mask band to the destination when the source raster has none.
.UNINDENT
.SS Advanced options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-oo <NAME>=<VALUE>
Dataset open option (format specific).
.sp
May be repeated.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-if <format>
Format/driver name to be attempted to open the input file(s). It is generally
not necessary to specify it, but it can be used to skip automatic driver
detection, when it fails to select the appropriate driver.
This option can be repeated several times to specify several candidate drivers.
Note that it does not force those drivers to open the dataset. In particular,
some drivers have requirements on file extensions.
.sp
May be repeated.
