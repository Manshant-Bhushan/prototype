.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This program burns vector geometries (points, lines, and polygons) into the
raster band(s) of a raster image.  Vectors are read from OGR supported vector
formats. If the output raster already exists, the affected pixels are updated
in\-place.
.sp
Note that on the fly reprojection of vector data to the coordinate system of the
raster data is only supported since GDAL 2.1.0.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-help\-general
Gives a brief usage message for the generic GDAL commandline options and exit.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b <band>
The band(s) to burn values into.  Multiple \-b arguments may be used to burn
into a list of bands.  The default is to burn into band 1.  Not used when
creating a new raster.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-i
Invert rasterization.  Burn the fixed burn value, or the burn value associated
with the first feature into all parts of the image \fInot\fP inside the
provided polygon.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
When the vector features contain a polygon nested within another polygon
(like an island in a lake), GDAL must be built against GEOS to get
correct results.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-at
Enables the ALL_TOUCHED rasterization option so that all pixels touched
by lines or polygons will be updated, not just those on the line render path,
or whose center point is within the polygon (behavior is unspecified when the
polygon is just touching the pixel center). Defaults to disabled for normal
rendering rules.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
When this option is enabled, the order of the input features (lines or polygons)
can affect the results. When two features touch each other, the last one (i.e. topmost)
will determine the burned pixel value at the edge.
You may wish to use the \fI\%\-sql\fP option to reorder the features (ORDER BY)
to achieve a more predictable result.
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-burn <value>
A fixed value to burn into a band for all objects.  A list of \fI\%\-burn\fP options
can be supplied, one per band being written to.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a <attribute_name>
Identifies an attribute field on the features to be used for a burn\-in value.
The value will be burned into all output bands.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-3d
Indicates that a burn value should be extracted from the \(dqZ\(dq values of the
feature. Works with points and lines (linear interpolation along each segment).
For polygons, works properly only if they are flat (same Z value for all
vertices).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-add
Instead of burning a new value, this adds the new value to the existing raster.
Suitable for heatmaps for instance.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-l <layername>
Indicates the layer(s) from the datasource that will be used for input
features.  May be specified multiple times, but at least one layer name or a
\fI\%\-sql\fP option must be specified (not both).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-where <expression>
An optional SQL WHERE style query expression to be applied to select features
to burn in from the input layer(s).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-sql <select_statement>
An SQL statement to be evaluated against the datasource to produce a
virtual layer of features to be burned in.
Starting with GDAL 3.7, the \fB@filename\fP syntax can be used to indicate
that the content is in the pointed filename.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
This option will be ignored if the \fI\%\-l\fP option has been set as well.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-dialect <dialect>
SQL dialect. In some cases can be used to use (unoptimized) OGR SQL instead of
the native SQL of an RDBMS by passing OGRSQL. The
\(dqSQLITE\(dq dialect can also be used with any datasource.
.sp
Added in version 2.1.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-of <format>
Select the output format. Starting with GDAL 2.3, if not specified, the
format is guessed from the extension (previously was GTiff). Use the short
format name.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a_nodata <value>
Assign a specified nodata value to output bands.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-init <value>
Pre\-initialize the output image bands with these values.  However, it is not
marked as the nodata value in the output file.  If only one value is given, the
same value is used in all the bands.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a_srs <srs_def>
Override the projection for the output file. If not specified, the projection of
the input vector file will be used if available. When using this option, no reprojection
of features from the SRS of the input vector to the specified SRS of the output raster,
so use only this option to correct an invalid source SRS.
The <srs_def> may be any of the usual GDAL/OGR forms, complete WKT, PROJ.4,
EPSG:n or a file containing the WKT.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-to <NAME>=<VALUE>
set a transformer
option suitable to pass to \fI\%GDALCreateGenImgProjTransformer2()\fP\&. This is
used when converting geometries coordinates to target raster pixel space. For
example this can be used to specify RPC related transformer options.
.sp
Added in version 2.3.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-co <NAME>=<VALUE>
Many formats have one or more optional creation options that can be
used to control particulars about the file created. For instance,
the GeoTIFF driver supports creation options to control compression,
and whether the file should be tiled.
.sp
The creation options available vary by format driver, and some
simple formats have no creation options at all. A list of options
supported for a format can be listed with the
\fI\%\-\-format\fP
command line option but the documentation for the format is the
definitive source of information on driver creation options.
See \fI\%Raster drivers\fP format
specific documentation for legal creation options for each format.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-te <xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax>
Set georeferenced extents. The values must be expressed in georeferenced units.
If not specified, the extent of the output file will be the extent of the vector
layers.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-tr <xres> <yres>
Set target resolution. The values must be expressed in georeferenced units.
Both must be positive values.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-tap
(target aligned pixels) Align
the coordinates of the extent of the output file to the values of the \fI\%\-tr\fP,
such that the aligned extent includes the minimum extent.
Alignment means that xmin / resx, ymin / resy, xmax / resx and ymax / resy are integer values.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-ts <width> <height>
Set output file size in pixels and lines. Note that \fI\%\-ts\fP cannot be used with
\fI\%\-tr\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-ot <type>
Force the output bands to be of the indicated data type. Defaults to \fBFloat64\fP,
unless the attribute field to burn is of type \fBInt64\fP, in which case \fBInt64\fP
is used for the output raster data type if the output driver supports it.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-optim {AUTO|VECTOR|RASTER}
Force the algorithm used (results are identical). Raster mode
is used in most cases and  optimizes read/write  operations.  The
vector mode is useful with a large amount of input features and
optimizes CPU use, provided that the output image is tiled.
Auto mode (the default) will choose the
algorithm based on input and output properties.
.sp
Added in version 2.3.

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-oo <NAME>=<VALUE>
Added in version 3.7.

Source dataset open option (format specific)
.UNINDENT

.TP
.B \-q
Suppress progress monitor and other non\-error output.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B <src_datasource>
Any OGR supported readable datasource.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B <dst_filename>
The GDAL supported output file.  Must support update mode access.
This file will be created if it does not already exist
If the output raster already exists, the affected pixels are updated in\-place.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The program creates a new target raster image when any of the \fI\%\-of\fP,
\fI\%\-a_nodata\fP, \fI\%\-init\fP, \fI\%\-a_srs\fP, \fI\%\-co\fP, \fI\%\-te\fP,
\fI\%\-tr\fP, \fI\%\-tap\fP, \fI\%\-ts\fP, or \fI\%\-ot\fP options are used.
The resolution or size must be specified using the \fI\%\-tr\fP or \fI\%\-ts\fP option for all new
rasters.  The target raster will be overwritten if it already exists and any of
these creation\-related options are used.
.SH C API
.sp
This utility is also callable from C with \fI\%GDALRasterize()\fP\&.
.sp
Added in version 2.1.
