.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBgdal vector clip\fP can be used to clip a vector dataset using
georeferenced coordinates.
.sp
Either \fI\%\-\-bbox\fP, \fI\%\-\-geometry\fP or \fI\%\-\-like\fP must be specified.
.sp
\fBclip\fP can also be used as a step of \fI\%gdal vector pipeline\fP\&.
.sp
Clipping sometimes results in geometries that are of a type not compatible
with the geometry type. This program splits multi\-geometries or geometry
collections into their parts for layers that are of a single geometry type
(such as point, linestring, polygon) and only keeps the parts that are of that
type. It also promotes single geometry types (e.g. polygons) to multi
geometry types (e.g. multi\-polygons). If the user needs to preserve any type of
intersection, the layer must use the \fBwkbUnknown\fP (any geometry) type.
.SS Standard options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-of, \-\-format, \-\-output\-format <OUTPUT\-FORMAT>
Which output vector format to use. Allowed values may be given by
\fBgdal \-\-formats | grep vector | grep rw | sort\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-co <NAME>=<VALUE>
Many formats have one or more optional dataset creation options that can be
used to control particulars about the file created. For instance,
the GeoPackage driver supports creation options to control the version.
.sp
May be repeated.
.sp
The dataset creation options available vary by format driver, and some
simple formats have no creation options at all. A list of options
supported for a format can be listed with the
\fI\%\-\-formats\fP
command line option but the documentation for the format is the
definitive source of information on driver creation options.
See \fI\%Vector drivers\fP format
specific documentation for legal creation options for each format.
.sp
Note that dataset creation options are different from layer creation options.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-overwrite
Allow program to overwrite existing target file or dataset.
Otherwise, by default, \fBgdal\fP errors out if the target file or
dataset already exists.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-active\-layer <ACTIVE\-LAYER>
Set the active layer. When it is specified, only the layer specified by
its name will be subject to the processing. Other layers will be not
modified.
If this option is not specified, all layers will be subject to the
processing.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-bbox <xmin>,<ymin>,<xmax>,<ymax>
Bounds to which to clip the dataset. They are assumed to be in the CRS of
the input dataset, unless \fI\%\-\-bbox\-crs\fP is specified.
The X and Y axis are the \(dqGIS friendly ones\(dq, that is X is longitude or easting,
and Y is latitude or northing.
Mutually exclusive with \fI\%\-\-like\fP and \fI\%\-\-geometry\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-bbox\-crs <CRS>
CRS in which the <xmin>,<ymin>,<xmax>,<ymax> values of \fI\%\-\-bbox\fP
are expressed. If not specified, it is assumed to be the CRS of the input
dataset.
Note that specifying \-\-bbox\-crs does not involve doing vector reprojection.
Instead, the bounds are reprojected from the bbox\-crs to the CRS of the
input dataset.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-geometry <WKT_or_GeoJSON>
Geometry as a WKT or GeoJSON string to which to clip the dataset.
If the input geometry is GeoJSON, its CRS is assumed to be WGS84, unless there is
a CRS defined in the GeoJSON geometry or \fI\%\-\-geometry\-crs\fP is specified.
If the input geometry is WKT, its CRS is assumed to be the one of the input dataset,
unless \fI\%\-\-geometry\-crs\fP is specified.
The X and Y axis are the \(dqGIS friendly ones\(dq, that is X is longitude or easting,
and Y is latitude or northing.
Mutually exclusive with \fI\%\-\-bbox\fP and \fI\%\-\-like\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-geometry\-crs <CRS>
CRS in which the coordinates values of \fI\%\-\-geometry\fP
are expressed. If not specified, it is assumed to be the CRS of the input
dataset.
Note that specifying \-\-geometry\-crs does not involve doing vector reprojection.
Instead, the bounds are reprojected from the geometry\-crs to the CRS of the
input dataset.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-like <DATASET>
Vector or raster dataset to use as a template for bounds.
If the specified dataset is a raster, its rectangular bounds are used as
the clipping geometry.
If the specified dataset is a vector dataset, its polygonal geometries
are unioned together to form the clipping geometry (beware that the result
union might not be perfect if there are gaps between individual polygon
features). If several layers are present,
\fI\%\-\-like\-sql\fP or \fI\%\-\-like\-layer\fP must be specified.
Mutually exclusive with \fI\%\-\-bbox\fP and \fI\%\-\-geometry\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-like\-sql <SELECT\-STATEMENT>
Select desired geometries from the vector clip dataset using an SQL query.
e.g \fBSELECT geom FROM my_layer WHERE country = \(aqFrance\(aq\fP\&.
Mutually exclusive with \fI\%\-\-like\-layer\fP and \fI\%\-\-like\-where\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-like\-layer <LAYER\-NAME>
Select the named layer from the vector clip dataset.
Mutually exclusive with \fI\%\-\-like\-sql\fP
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-like\-where <WHERE\-EXPRESSION>
Restrict desired geometries from vector clip dataset layer based on an attribute query.
e.g \fBcountry = \(aqFrance\(aq\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Advanced options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-oo <NAME>=<VALUE>
Dataset open option (format specific).
.sp
May be repeated.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-if <format>
Format/driver name to be attempted to open the input file(s). It is generally
not necessary to specify it, but it can be used to skip automatic driver
detection, when it fails to select the appropriate driver.
This option can be repeated several times to specify several candidate drivers.
Note that it does not force those drivers to open the dataset. In particular,
some drivers have requirements on file extensions.
.sp
May be repeated.
